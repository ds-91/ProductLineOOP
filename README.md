# Production Line
This project is a JavaFX desktop application that allows uses to create products and send them to
production. I made it independently as part of my Object Oriented Programming class project. I made
it from September to December of 2019. Although it was for an assignment, I had fun making it and I
definitely learned a lot about OOP fundamentals. Project for FGCU's Object Oriented Programming class.
